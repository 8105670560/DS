This project demonstrates various data structures and algorithms implemented in C. The focus is on fundamental data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees. Each implementation is followed by examples for better understanding and usage.

Features
Stack: Basic stack implementation with operations like push, pop, and peek.
Queue: Queue implementation using arrays and linked lists, supporting enqueue, dequeue, and front operations.
Linked List: Singly and doubly linked lists with various operations like insertion, deletion, and reversal.
Binary Trees: Binary tree creation, traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder), and various tree manipulations.
